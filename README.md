# GitHub Deployment Workflow

This project demonstrates how to use GitHub Actions to automatically deploy a static website to GitHub Pages. Whenever you push changes to the `index.html` file on the main branch, the workflow will trigger and update the website on GitHub Pages.

## Technologies Used

- GitHub Actions
- GitHub Pages

## How it Works

- Any changes to `index.html` in the main branch are automatically deployed to GitHub Pages by a workflow defined in `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`.
